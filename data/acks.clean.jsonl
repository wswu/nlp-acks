We propose a variational training scheme that has the advantage of a large pre-training corpus but without using as much computing resources. On low frequency words, our proposed scheme also outperforms naive pre-training. In the future, we want to incorporate WordNet knowledge to further reduce perplexity on infrequent words."}

Intel markets the hardware as a regular expression processor, not a deterministic pushdown automaton. 7 Conclusion Language identiﬁcation and language modeling entail scanning that can be ofﬂoaded to regular expression hardware. The hardware works best for small models, such as those used in language identiﬁcation. Like CPUs, random memory accesses are slow. We believe it will be useful for webscale extraction problems, where language identiﬁcation and coarse language modeling are used to ﬁlter large amounts of data. We plan to investigate a new hardware version that Intel is preparing."}
